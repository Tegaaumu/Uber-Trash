# UberTrash - Every Trash is a Ride to Millions
Africa is at a pivotal point; in 2023, the waste crisis in Africa reached alarming proportions, with a staggering number of over 2.01 billion tons of household waste annually. This points to a global crisis. 

Shockingly, 70-80% of this waste is recyclable, presenting a significant opportunity for sustainable waste management practices. However, the reality paints a dire picture: only **4%** of the waste is currently recycled, with 90% of it disposed of unlawfully, according to the World Health Organization.

While food waste can be organically disposed of,  Plastics are especially problematic. If not collected and managed properly, they contaminate and affect waterways and ecosystems for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. [In 2016, the world generated 242 million tonnes of plastic waste, or 12 percent of all solid waste](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2018/09/20/global-waste-to-grow-by-70-percent-by-2050-unless-urgent-action-is-taken-world-bank-report#), according to the report.

Another report released in 2022 by [UNEP](https://www.unep.org/) report revealed that Africa generates 17 million tonnes of plastic waste annually. Of this, a mere 12% is recycled, while 70% is mismanaged, ending up in landfills or the environment.

These issues led our team to develop an innovative solution allowing everyone to be part of the change to build a sustainable world. 

**The Growing Waste Crisis in Africa: Ubertrash to the Rescue.**

Ubertrash is an innovative application that allows users to book Plastic-Can Riders,  pick up their plastics, and get paid by the rider. the rider takes the cans to the terminal and gets paid for the plastic delivery in Solana coins.

First, once a user logs into `Ubertrash.com`, they are asked to connect their wallet. we made sure only the solana wallet can be used, Once connected. 

You are offered two choices. **Order for a PickUp** or **Become a Pickup Rider**


## Become a PickUp Rider

To become a pickup rider, you must complete your KYC by registering your account and fill your details, and once you have that setup, you will be able to see pickup messages from users.

Once a rider accepts a pickup, he becomes that user's manager and can contact the user to arrange pickup. 

The user must meet a threshold of cans to drop off before it can be picked up, and only when the rider approves would the token be sent to the user via the Solana wallet connected above.

Once a user orders for pick-up, a notification is sent to all riders with the pickup location; once a rider accepts the order, he gets to see the phone number and address of the user and can go ahead and make pickup arrangements.

There is a timer of 4 hours once an order has been confirmed, as after the time elapses, the user can reorder another pickup. 

Once the cans have been picked, it shows processing on the user dashboard as the transaction is kept pending; once the pickup rider confirms the transaction, the funds are moved to the user, and the transaction is complete.

The rider can accumulate the plastic cans and then drop them at the terminal as a rider has to reach a threshold to drop at the terminal to reduce cost where it will be recycled and sold, and more money will be deployed into the eco-system, thereby keeping the environment clean and safe for our future generation while generating revenue. 


## To Use the Platform - User

To use the platform, you only need to connect your wallet and create an account to keep track of how many cans you have sold and also for our reward program, where we aim to give the highest plastic can transactions of the week or month tokens or NFTs to boast a competitive spirit while solving real-world problems,

First, the user must connect their wallet, as this would aid in easy disbursements of funds into their accounts because once the pickup approves the transaction, the token is sent to the user account.

Second, the user must allocate the amount of plastic they intend to sell, as they must reach a threshold before ordering for pickup. Our minimum amount is 500 plastic bottles, which is equivalent to $5 in Solana tokens.

## Our Aim 

We aim to build a fast, transparent, and easy avenue from waste to wealth in Africa


## Our Objective 

Our objective is as follows 


- reduce the global carbon footprint by 
- Create jobs for over 400+ riders and over 20000 platform users in Nigeria and Africa.
- Build an ecosystem where plastic waste recycling is cheap and easy to implement in African zones.

UberTrash aims to build an ecosystem of young people passionate about the environment and work hard to keep it clean.

With the Solana eco-system, we aim to build a learn-to-reward where we set up a task that has to do with cleaning the environment and getting a reward for doing it. 

This would, in turn, create a momentum that popularises the Solana network in rural/urban areas as our focus is within Africa.
